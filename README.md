FLASK AND DOCKER are frameworks to expose ML Models as a rest API. This is what 'productionalizing' ML solutions means.

Make sure Postman is installed - www.getpostman.com

1) Exposing the model as a webservice, which is what this repo code will do eventually.
2) Incorporate model in existing software
3) Automate existing workflows
