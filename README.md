# Flask_docker_101

FLASK AND DOCKER are frameworks to expose ML Models as a rest API.

What does putting ML models to production mean? - 

It means one of 3 things:

1) Exposing the model as a webservice, which is what this repo code will do eventually.
2) Incorporate model in existing software
3) Automate existing workflows
